In small groups of 7 people we designed and built a precision desktop lathe for cutting aluminum and steel.  I was the FEA guru for my team, and primarily focused on flexure designs, and full lathe modeling .</p>

The class focuses on learning C++ programming, controls and computer vision, through a two-wheeled robot. Our first task was to develop a 8-bit messaging protocol between the microprocessor and the Ubuntu computer to control our robot. Next, we had the idea of using this robot as a drawing robot. We realized that every printer is limited by the size of its carriage and that with a wheeled robot and computer vision, we could print out banners and pictures as big as we want. Our device could print out drawings and texts on a 6ft by 6ft support on the floor.</p>
